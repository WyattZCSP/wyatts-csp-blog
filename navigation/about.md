> **Hello, I am Wyatt Zimmer and these are some of my favorite things:**

- I have loved cars for much of my life, and they are definitely one of my biggest hobbies. My favorite brand is Pagani, and some of my all time favorite cars are the Pagani Zonda Revo HP Barchetta, The Bugatti Bolide, and the Apollo Evo.

That's an Apollo Evo, I like them so much because of the unique and creative design that tests what car manufacterers thought was possible. 

- I am new to coding, I have never coded before or taken any coding related classes, but I am determined to learn and do better. I hope for this class to teach me what i need to know about coding, so that I can better understand how computers work and develop some skills for the future.

- One of my favorite activities is biking. I mountain bike with my friends and Dad on the local trail systems very often. I love mountain biking becaus eit allows me to be free. In the past, I have taken a few trips to Mammoth Mountain during the summer to mountain bike. It's another level there, and it deepened my love for the sport even more.
