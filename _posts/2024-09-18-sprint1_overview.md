# Hacks Tools & Equipment Play

## [Example]({{site.baseurl}}/2024/09/09/hacks_tools_equipment.html)

> I learned about different data types in **Python** and tested these in [an online python playground](https://programiz.pro/ide/python)

# Hacks GitHub Pages Playground

## [Notebook Error Pages]({{site.baseurl}}/error_notebook.html)

> I wrote a blog about all of my errors that occured througout making my calculator and cookie clicker pages.

## [Nighthawk SASS Example]
> .cookie-clicker-btn {
    background: url("../../images/cookie.png") no-repeat;
    background-size: contain;
    border-style: none;
    filter: drop-shadow(5px 5px 5px grey);
    width: 100vw;
    height: 100vh;
}

> In this project, I used SCSS to style my buttons and different elements of the page. I created a new file called **/_cookie-clicker.scss** within the directory **/_sass**.
> This file handles the style of the custom classes I included in my html file. Additionally, in the creation of the actual page and its functionality, I observed the different data types we will explore in CSP.

# Hacks SASS Basics
Some basic SASS Hacks that I used were:
background-color: (color)
border-style: (style)
border-color: (color)

## Changing my theme

> In the **config.yml** file, I changed my theme to the different options, however, I thought the cayman theme looked the best. 

# Pair Programming

> My partner and I made custom buttons based on the layout we were given. We decided that our buttons will change the content of the paragraps. Together, we worked on this to make it operate correctly.

> My partner and I also decided to work on discovering some of the different features within Python syntax. We worked together to develop our app while researching.
