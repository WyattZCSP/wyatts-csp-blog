| 5 Things you've learned over 12 weeks, Issues, Burndown, Presentation    | I’ve learned a lot regarding server deployment, building a backend/api, creating functioning features, and putting together a cohesive website. Over the last 12 weeks I've learned a lot and become a much more versatile programmer.                       | 4/5    |
| Full Stack Project Demo, including CPT requirement highlights, and N@tM feedback       | I’ve covered the CPT requirements in my feature (UserCars). I also thought that our team did a great job at the N@TM event, as many people complemented our website's looks, features, and even said that we had the best project.          |  2/2   |
| Project Feature blog write up, using CPT/FRQ language  | I covered the main idea of my feature (UserCars) and provided both a simple and technicle overview of the feature. I also provided a demo of the feature.                  | 0.9/1   |
| MCQ      | I completed the MCQ and anlayzed my answers. I also listed some of the answers I got wrong and looked over them so I get them right next time.                               | 0.95/1   |
| Personal Reflection     |  I think that overall I've been very honest with my self reflection, and It has gotten me thinking about what I need  to imporve on for the AP Exam, and general work in the future. | 1/1   |

Next Steps: Now that I’ve completed this project, I think that I'll try to use the skills that I have built up in the future, when building a website for my business, and while taking CS related courses in College. |

Strengths:
Styling was definitely a strength of mine, I was able to make our site feel cohesive and have a consistent theme, I also had strengths in the frontend UX side of things, and I was able to make a few successful features.

Weaknesses:
Communication and Backend coding were some weaknesses of mine, I had no prior experience working with backend which made it a clear struggle for me. I also could've been more communicative with my teammates throughout building our website.
