Summary
After getting these responses back from people who tested the website, I’ve noticed that there are changes that should be made to improve the user’s experience. A big one is the icons on the gas, electric, and dream car pages. They are too big and don’t fit the theme we have developed in our site. Changing this would help the user experience. Also, some features like dark mode and a confirm button would help make the user experience much more fluid.


Reviewing other groups:

Aiden’s Game
I looked at Aiden Lau’s CSA project which was a 2D game with different prompts. I liked how there was a mini quiz minigame in it. One thing that could be improved was creating a custom text message box instead of using alert, there were also a few bugs with moving around and going to different areas that should be fixed.

Aranya’s Fullstack Webpage
I checked out Aranya’s fullstack webpage called Frostbyte. I thought it was interesting how this group also had a quiz feature. It also had a national park “personality quiz” which was also interesting. I think to improve the page and user experience, they could work on making a more dynamic UI design.
