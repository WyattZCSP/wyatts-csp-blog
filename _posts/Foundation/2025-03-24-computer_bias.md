## Example:  
In the facial recognition software used by some law enforcement agencies, studies have shown that it is less accurate in identifying people with darker skin tones.  

## Who is affected:  
This bias affects people of color, particularly Black and Brown individuals, who are more likely to be misidentified. This can lead to wrongful arrests or increased surveillance.  

## Potential Cause: 
A potential cause of this bias is the lack of diverse training data. If the software is trained mostly on images of lighter-skinned individuals, it struggles to accurately recognize faces with darker skin tones.

There was a time when I asked ChatGPT for help with a coding problem, but the response didn’t fully solve the issue. I was trying to debug an error in my code, but the explanation was too vague, and the solution didn’t address the specific bug I was facing. It was frustrating because I wanted a clear, working fix but had to spend extra time searching elsewhere. One way ChatGPT could be improved is by offering more detailed, step-by-step explanations and asking clarifying questions to better understand complex coding issues.

Bias could sneak into a fitness tracking app by providing one-size-fits-all recommendations that overlook differences in physical abilities, age, or health conditions. For example, setting a universal step goal may exclude users with mobility challenges, while calorie estimates may be inaccurate for people with varying metabolic rates. To make the app more inclusive, I would offer customizable goals, alternative activity tracking for different abilities, and personalized progress markers based on each user’s unique needs.

## Digital Tool: TikTok  

## Identify Potential Bias: TikTok’s "For You" page often favors popular trends but can overlook creators from marginalized communities. The algorithm tends to promote conventionally attractive people and viral content, making it harder for smaller or less mainstream creators to be seen. This can lead to less representation of different ages, body types, and cultures.  

## Analyze the Cause: This bias may come from the algorithm focusing on engagement—like likes and shares—without considering creator diversity. If the algorithm is trained on popular content, it can keep promoting the same types of videos.  

## Propose a Solution: TikTok could update the algorithm to highlight a wider range of creators. They could also add tools for users to explore diverse content and regularly check for bias in the recommendations.
