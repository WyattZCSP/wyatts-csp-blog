**Random Color Generator Development Process**

First, I divided the page into sections, so that only a portion of it would change colors. I named this portion "color box". I used the function "getRandomInt" so that I could get a random number that coordinated to a specific color, and get the number randomly so that each color had the same, random chance of being picked at any given time. Next, I added a few different colors that it could land on inside the color box.
