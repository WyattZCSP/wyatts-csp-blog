## **Question Types**:
  There are some "select two answers" questions and single-answer questions in the multiple-choice questions. These evaluate your application and understanding of important computer topics.
## **Topics Covered**:
  - Programming (concepts, algorithms, abstractions)
  - Data and information (data manipulation, visualizations, patterns)
  - The internet (security, protocols, data flow)
  - Global impacts of computing (ethics, societal change)
## **Key Concepts**
- **Algorithm Analysis**: Read pseudocode with ease and make predictions about how it will behave.
- **Abstractions**: Recognize how complex systems are made simpler by abstractions.
- **Data Representation**: Understand data compression, binary numbers, and other data-related concepts like bits.
- **Cybersecurity**: Understand internet protocols, security threats, and encryption.
## **Questions I got Wrong**
  - ![Question 1](https://assets.learnosity.com/organisations/537/4c2e7b0b-f9f1-4754-8cdb-cfd8404f6888.jpg)

  - **Which of the following best describes one of the benefits of using an iterative and incremental process of program development?**
    Correct Answer: It helps programmers identify errors as components are added to a working program. This is because Incrementally adding code segments to correct, working programs can help programmers identify new errors that are introduced.
