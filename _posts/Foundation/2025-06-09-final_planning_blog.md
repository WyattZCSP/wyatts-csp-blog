# üß† Final Project ‚Äì ShotSpot

ShotSpot is a platform designed for photographers to share their work, receive constructive feedback, and connect with potential clients.

## Connecting with Passions

- As you know,I'm very passionate about cars and I have a videography page. This class has developed my skills for handling clients, and learning how to put myself in a situation for new opportunity. Night at the museum was an amazing opportunity for me to gain experience talking to people, and helped me to develop my situational awareness,and speaking skills.

## üöÄ Looking Forward

One of the most valuable lessons I've learned this year is the importance of teamwork. Whether debugging code, designing interfaces, or planning our project roadmap, collaborating with a group taught me communication, flexibility, and trust. These skills will guide me not only in future classes and internships, but also in sports, work, and life in general.

In the future, I plan to scale ShotSpot beyond the classroom and use it as a foundation for my **videography business**. I want to transform it into a larger platform that offers photographers and videographers access to opportunities and exposure they might not otherwise find. Combining technical skills with creativity and a community focus, I hope to build something that helps others grow while continuing to develop my own talents.
