**Q2:**
A small team of wildlife researchers is working on a project that uses motion-activated field cameras to capture images of animals at study sites. The team is considering using a “citizen science” approach to analyze the images. Which of the following best explains why such an approach is considered useful for this project?

**Correct Answer:**
The image analysis is likely to take a longer time for the research team than for a distributed group of individuals.

**Q18:**
The grid below contains a robot represented as a triangle, initially facing right. The robot can move into a white or gray square but cannot move into a black region.

The code segment below uses the procedure GoalReached, which evaluates to true if the robot is in the gray square and evaluates to false otherwise.

```
REPEAT UNTIL (GoalReached ())

{

<MISSING CODE>

}
```

Which of the following replacements for *MISSING CODE* can be used to move the robot to the gray square?

**Correct Answer:**
```
REPEAT UNTIL (CAN_MOVE (forward) = false)

{

MOVE_FORWARD ()

}

ROTATE_RIGHT ()
```

**Q36:**
A group of planners are using a simulation to examine whether or not a park that they are designing is going to affect foot traffic in the area. The simulation uses a model that includes input variables for the park such as the number of entrances, sidewalks, and bike trails and the square footage of open space (grassy areas). The simulation can then be run multiple times using different values for the input variables to represent different park designs.
However, the simulation takes a very long time to run. The planners update the model by removing some variables they consider less important than others.
Of the following, which is the most likely effect the updated model will have on the simulation?

**Correct Answer:**
The updated model is likely to decrease the runtime of the simulation because the time required for simulations generally depends on the complexity of the model used.
